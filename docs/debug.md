# Debug

## Serial connection

The following UARTs can be used to debug EDK2 on Radxa Orion O1:

* UART1: EC
* UART2: AP
* UART3: Debug
* UART4: PM
* UART5: SE

UART2 is the default management console for EDK2 and the operationg system.

UART3 is only available when EDK2 is build as DEBUG image.

All UARTs other than UART1 use 115200 baud. EC UART can be viewed with the following command:

```bash
picocom -b 460800 --imap lfcrlf /dev/ttyX
```

In general, the log output order after power is connected is as follow:

```
EC ---Power On---> SE ---> AP ---> Debug
```

If you enable `devenv`, then you can run `edk2-console` to launch above 4 UART consoles at once.
Please first create a local `devenv.local.nix` based on `devenv.local.nix.example` to define the local UART devices before using this command.

## Installation

Once build completes, you can find the complete set of artifacts under `debian/edk2-cix/usr/share/edk2/`.

Follow [Installation guide](install.md#create-the-bios-update-disk) to continue.
